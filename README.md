# GolfClub
My overall task required me to create a usable and effective programming solution which a set of specified criteria. I was tasked to mainly use arrays and pointers.  In conjunction to this, it was pivotal to continue my improvement and understanding of C++ language and physical programming in order to construct a solution to fix a specified problem. Alongside a systematic approach to separate components during code development. Communication was a key element in prior preparation and planning, division of workload and for presentation purposes. 

# Guidelines & Brief:

The classic three-tier architecture should be employed:
• Presentation Layer: C++ (command prompt)
• Application Layer: C++ code
• Storage (persistence layer): files

You are hired by a Golf Club to develop a program for entering, calculating and printing score cards.
The solution should (minimal requirements):
• Allow scorecards to be maintained by allowing players to
         o create a new score card,
         o enter strokes to score cards,
         o print scorecards,
         o calculate results, etc.
• Allow the Club management to:
         o add and remove players to the club,
         o check player accounts and scorecards, etc.
To achieve a high mark, extra functionality and features should be included as you think necessary for your program.
